.loads() turns a JSON object string into a dictionary. This is useful for accessing content 
from APIs and inserting them into HTML templates. 

When retrieving the raw JSON data from the API, there is a b'' in front of the dictionary. This signals that it is a byte data and that in order for it to be usable, it has to be decoded via utf-8 within python.
