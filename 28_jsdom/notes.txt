--------------------------------------------------

- The calling of red() and stripe() do not overwrite each other. The only way for these to "work" properly is by having uncolored text.
- addItem defaults to appending to the end of the list, while you can specify where to remove an item from a list with removeItem.
- If you have multiple color variables for a text, the last variable becomes the color that it takes on.
