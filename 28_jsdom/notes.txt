- The calling of red() and stripe() do not overwrite each other. The only way for these to "work" properly is by having uncolored text.
- addItem defaults to appending to the end of the list, while you can specify where to remove an item from a list with removeItem.
- If you have multiple color variables for a text, the last variable becomes the color that it takes on.
- Functions can be called directly in the JS file and since the HTML file reads this, the changes will be reflected immediately upon loading the HTML file.
- Do not declare a type when creating a new variable using var.
- Remember to use semicolons! Not using semicolons properly may result in errors.
- One can get elements from an HTML file by id or by tag name. The function document.getElementById only returns one while getElementsByTagName returns a list of multiple. They can use appendChild to append an item to that element.
- One can create an element in an HTML file using createElement, which takes a tag name. Adding the text to that element can be done with innerHTML.
