Notes
- If you increase the radius by a decimal value, make sure to check if the radius is greater than or equal to 250, rather than checking only if it's equal. 
- From the QAF, this simple format for drawDot was posted:
    var drawDot = function() {
        window.cancelAnimationFrame( AREQUESTID...WHEREDOUGETIT? );

        //draw the dot

        requestID = window.requestAnimationFrame( WHUTGOHURR );
    };

    It also works when updating requestID before drawing the dot, but it does make more sense to do that after drawing the dot.
