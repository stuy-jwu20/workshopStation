The dropdown menu of the navbar requires the use of JavaScript. The background color of 
the navbar can be set with a style tag or with bg-* (* can be replaced with dark, light,
or primary). This is also used to set the color for other elements, like stack borders. 
There is a class "row" that allows different elements of the page to be displayed next 
to each other. Column sizes can be set using col-*-* (first * can be replaced by sm, md, 
lg, or xl; second * can be replaced by a number). "p" is used to set padding size and "m" 
is for margin size. Different letters added on to that indicate the different sides (t, b, 
l, r, x, y). To indicate the size, a number (in the range 0-5) is attached with a dash. 
"auto" can also be used in place of that number (but only for margin).
