## app.route('/')

Predictions:

We predict that printing app will print the name of the app variable as defined in line 12. 
We also predict that printing 'request' will print the memory space. 

Reconcilation

We were wrong about what printing request could result in. It resulted in the IP address of the localhost.

Notables:

request.args would always return nothing. request.headers gives information about the client and browser.

## app.route('/auth')

It should be the same as the login page, but we predict that the request.args will return whatever we submitted into the form.

Reconcilation

As predicted, the request.args returned the queries we gave in as well as the query number. 

Notables

After submitting the form it returns a blank page with a specified string.

-----

Other Notables

The request obj will default to GET.
