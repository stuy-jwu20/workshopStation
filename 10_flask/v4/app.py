# If _name_ = _main_:
# We think this would print "about to print_name_... and then in the next line in terminal
# it will print _main_. It'll print then print no hablo queso! on the website you get
# from running the program.
# With app.debug on, the computer will spit out some debugging code or whatever.
#If _name != _main_:
#nothing will happen.

# Runtime output: As predicted
