app = Flask(__name__) #create instance of the class

def hello_world():
    return "No hablo queso!"

app.run()

#This version differs from the previous one in that it doesn't have the print statement
#in the function. I think this will result in the difference of the program not printing
#_main_ to the terminal. Otherwise, everything else looks like the same.

# Runtime output: As predicted
