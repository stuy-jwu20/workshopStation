K15 - Sessions Greetings/More form handling in HTML in flask app/We worked on creating a flask app that uses session capabilities to allow a user to login and logout.
2021-10-18


When using different request methods, you would use request.args to get input
when the request.method is GET, while you would have to use request.form to
get input when the request.method is POST.

You can record the user's credentials in a cookie by using session. You can
check if someone is logged in by checking a key value in session. To log out,
just pop that key value from the session.

You can press F12 to open up the browser console in firefox. To see the cookie
created, you can click on the storage tab.

If user is not already logged in, we can check to see if the username and
password matches. If not, we just print an error on the login page,
prompting them to login again. If the credentials match, we add it to
the session dictionary.
