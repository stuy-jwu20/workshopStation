Anything Notable:

- Nothing in particular. 
- It's a lot cleaner at times when you can replace some disgusting code with a nice loop or a template.

EGO:

- I feel slightly called out by the fact that most programmers learn in the "detached"
direction as I agree with that sentiment. Though I don't agree that I feel like
I am attached to the programs I create.
- I feel that the section is really accurate in its descriptions of the archetypes. In terms of owning programs, I have no comment on it.
