Anything Notable:

- Nothing in particular. 
- It's a lot cleaner at times when you can replace some disgusting code with a nice loop or a template.
- There are already some useful library functions that are easy to read, use, and understand.
There's no need to write a bunch of code for something that's already been done. 

EGO:

- I feel slightly called out by the fact that most programmers learn in the "detached"
direction as I agree with that sentiment. Though I don't agree that I feel like
I am attached to the programs I create.
- I feel that the section is really accurate in its descriptions of the archetypes. In terms of owning programs, I have no comment on it. 
- The author makes a good point. I do feel like I get too attached to my programs, sometimes.
If I struggle on something long enough, I usually don't feel like abandoning my work, or asking people for help, even though I should.
I just try to make it work, and this is definitely an ego thing; I want to feel like I'm good at programming.
