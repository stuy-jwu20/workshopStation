The Math.random() function in Java generates a number from 0 to 1, so you have to
use Math.floor after multiplying by at least 10 so you can get an integer for the numbers to work.

When using .addEventListener, the <value> part of it must be called first via a function(){<fxn>} in order to trigger the action upon getting the event to happen.
