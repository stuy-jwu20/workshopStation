Notables:

Our group had a rough start using inline CSS to start off with to format the website. Our main issue was first trying to figure out what was/wasn't allowed in terms of what was considered inlines and what wasn't. 

However, once we figured out how to format it using inline, the internal and external formatting came by like a breeze. The other two were done rather quickly, which minor changes to adjust for the different styles of formatting with the CSS. 

To keep consistency with the bacon ipsum shown on the example, we also chose a bacon ipsum generator to go along with our website.

We also learned that formatting some of the CSS in a certain way (e.g. flex or float) would "break" the website in that it would format in a way that we didn't expect it to which made things slightly harder.
