Questions: 

Is it more efficient to use the built in csv library rather than using the downloaded module pandas to process .csv files and data structures of the like?

Similarly, which would be better to use: dictReader or csvReader? Is either one more efficient than the other?

Does it matter if you use __name__ == "__main__" instead of main()?

Comments: 

Many people had a very better clever way of using weighted random choices using the random library. I didn't think about doing that so I should keep that in mind for the future if we need to do something involving random dictionaries.

Concerns: 

Not any.
