K34 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-04-27t
time spent: 35 minutes

notables:
- One to many: array in parent seems very useful..
- I also like that you can do a scalar in child
- It's funny why it's called a bucket pattern when it's just nested data.
- Precomputing is a great idea!
Reminder: Evaluate your workload at the beginning!
